        <p>
            I am currently a a <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/research/fellowship-programs"> Stanford Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence</a> Postdoctoral Fellow workng with the <a
                href="https://cogtoolslab.github.io/">Cognitive Tools Lab</a>. I also maintain affiliations with the <a href="https://cocosci.mit.edu/"> Computational Cognitive Science</a> and <a
                href="https://lingo.csail.mit.edu/"> LINGO</a> labs at MIT. I completed my PhD at
            MIT in Brain and Cognitive Sciences in July 2024, advised by Josh Tenenbaum and Jacob Andreas. I received my B.S. and M.S. in computer science at Stanford, advised by Dan Jurafsky and
            Sebastian Thrun.

        <p>
            My research asks how people <strong>understand and learn from language</strong>. How do our minds represent and <strong>construct meaning</strong> from language â€” how do we usefully relate
            words and sentences to everything else that we know and believe? And how do we <strong>learn so much from language</strong>, from new concepts to entirely new sciences and theories? I am
            also interested more generally in how minds can tractably and usefully represent the world at all in order to reason, as well as how we learn new concepts or theories in general over a
            lifetime.
        </p>

        <p>
            My work seeks to answer these questions by combining theory-driven cognitive experiments with formal computational tools, including <i>structured probabilistic models of cognition, program
                synthesis, and machine learning approaches</i>. I am particularly interested in approaches that can <i>scale</i> our theoretical and empirical picture of how we understand and learn
            from language, both by explaining how language relates to other domains of psychology (like intuitive physical or social cognition) and how we can unify disparate formal approaches to
            modeling language (like those from linguistics, cognitive science, and AI). Iâ€™m also a writer. I love
            a heady and intimate sentence, and would like to build models that explain even a sliver of what
            we get out of ones as rich and unruly as <a href="https://app.simplenote.com/publish/Zyr2yb">these</a>.
